## 2. Additional Business Rules

* A user can only review a product that he has purchased.
* A product's price must be a positive value.
* A purchase's address must have to be in the user's addresses book.
* A product must have its category's required properties filled in.
* If the administrator archives a product, it will be removed from every cart and wishlist.
* If the category has no products, it can not be added to the navigation bar. But, if that same category is in the navigation bar, it will be removed.
* The total attribute of a purchase is the sum of the prices of the purchased items.
