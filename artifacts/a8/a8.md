## Revision history
 
Changes made to the first submission:  
1. Some verifications were added to input fields using REGEX and other HTML elements such as "type" and "required".
2. Some verifications were set on the server side to check if all the values received from the client are valid.
3. Some try/catch blocks were added surrounding Eloquent calls so that it can catch and handle the exceptions thrown by the Eloquent.
4. API’s are now ready to handle and give some feedback (error or success messages) when they get an answer from the server.
5. In case of errors not handled by the APIs, such as "try to access a page that doesn't exist" or "try to access a page without permissions", the user is redirected to the Error pages (404 or 403). Those pages' design will be improved in the future.
