# A9: Main accesses to the database and transactions

This artefact shows the main accesses to the database, including the transactions.

For each transaction, the isolation level is explicitly stated and read-only transactions are identified to improve global performance. For each identified access, the SQL code and the reference of web resources (A7) are provided.

## 1. Main Accesses
 
Main accesses to the database.

## 2. Transactions
 
Transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data, with a proper justification.
 
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>T01</th>
        <td>Retrieve a product's reviews.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>Web Resource</td>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/literallysofia/lbaw1761/blob/documentation/artifacts/a7/a7.md#r401-product-page">R401</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Isolation level</td>
        <td>SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Justification</td>
        <td>In the middle of the transaction, the insertion of new rows in the review can occur, which implies that the information retrieved in the query that selects the reviews counter and the query that selects the reviews is different, consequently resulting in a Phantom Read. It's READ ONLY because it only uses Selects.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY
    
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM reviews AS R
    WHERE R.product_id = $prod_id
    
    SELECT R.title, R.content, R.date, R.score, U.name
    FROM reviews AS R
    WHERE R.product_id = $prod_id
    
COMMIT;
```

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>T02</th>
        <td>Retrieve a product, its information and properties.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>Web Resource</td>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/literallysofia/lbaw1761/blob/documentation/artifacts/a7/a7.md#r602-cart-checkout-action">R602</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Isolation level</td>
        <td>READ COMMITTED</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Justification</td>
        <td>The isolation level Read Committed ensures that an operation will never read data another application has changed but not yet committed. This means that when retrieving a product's information, all data should be equally updated and committed.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED

    SELECT name, price, score, brand, quantity
    FROM products
    WHERE id = $prod_id

    SELECT path
    FROM photos
    WHERE product_id = $prod_id

    SELECT V.name, P.name
    FROM values AS V, values_lists AS VL, category_properties AS CP, properties AS P
    WHERE VL.product_id = $prod_id
    AND V.values_list_id = VL.id
    AND VL.category_property_id = CP.id AND CP.property_id = P.id

COMMIT;
```

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>T03</th>
        <td>Complete a new purchase</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>Web Resource</td>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/literallysofia/lbaw1761/blob/documentation/artifacts/a7/a7.md#r602-cart-checkout-action">R602</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Isolation level</td>
        <td>REPEATABLE READ</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Justification</td>
        <td>In order to maintain consistency, it's necessary to use a transaction to ensure that the all the code executes without errors. If an error occurs, a ROLLBACK is issued (when the available quantity is not enough nor the insertion of a product_purchase fails, per example). The isolation level is Repeatable Read, because otherwise, an update of product.quantity could happen, due to an update in the table products committed by a concurrent transaction, and as a result, there could be not enough product quantity.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ

    IF EXISTS (SELECT quantity_available FROM products 
               WHERE id = $proId
               AND quantity_available >= $quantity) 
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO purchases (total, user_id, address_id)
        VALUES ($total, $userid, $address_id)

        INSERT INTO product_purchases (product_id, purchase_id, quantity, price) 
        VALUES ($proId, $purchId, $quantity, $price)
    
        UPDATE products
        SET quantity = quantity - $quantity
        WHERE product_id = $proId
    END

COMMIT;
