# A3: User Interface Prototype

This user interfaces prototype(or horizontal prototype) has the following goals:

1. Help to identify and describe the user requirements, and raise new ones;
2. Preview and empirically test the user interface of the product to be developed;
3. Enable quick and multiple iterations on the design of the user interface.

This artefact includes three elements:

1. Overview of the interface elements and features common to all pages;
2. Overview of the information system from the viewpoint of the users(sitemap);
3. Identification and description of the main interactions with the system, organized as sequences of screens (storyboards).

The interface's descriptions are presented on the end of the document.

## 1. Interface and common features

**Sweven** is a web application based on HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. The user interface was implemented using the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

**Figure 1:** Interface's guidelines.

1. Shop name
2. Navbar
3. Page Content
4. Footer

In this figure some characteristics common to all pages are highlighted:

* The web design implemented is has a responsive flow which allows the web page layout to suit most screen sizes and resolutions, from a 15'' laptop to a 4'' smartphone.
* The common links and buttons to the several pages, mainly the ones placed in the navigation bar and footer, maintain their position to deliver a consistent user experience.
* When it comes to button contrast, the most important actions have an all-black color so it stands out, meanwhile the least important remain with a black stroke and white background.


## 2. Sitemap

A sitemap is a visual representation of the relationship between the different pages of a website that shows how all the information fits together.

The sitemap gives the project team an idea of how the website is going to be build by helping to clarify the information hierarchy.

## 3. Storyboards

Storyboards are presented to represent some of the main interactions with the system using a sequence of interfaces and explaining how navigation is done between them.
