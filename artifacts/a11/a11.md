## 1. Product presentation
 
The purpose of this project was to develop a web application for an online tech store, called Sweven, which means a vision seen in sleep, a dream. From the Old English to the modern days, this word inspired us. In order to have a great product diversity, the store sells multiple tech brands and product types, such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets.

Sweven has an adaptive design and a detailed navigation system by arranging the products through categories. In each category page, the user is able to narrow his search by applying the filters brand and maximum prince. Besides that, the user can search for a product by name using the search bar. In order to provide a reliable service, each product has a review section, which allows users to not only review the items they purchased but also to view other people's opinions. Each review includes a score and a short description, which results in the product to have an average score. Besides, users have the ability to save favorite products in a wishlist and view the history of all previous purchases. The administrator is responsible for managing the purchases and products of the platform. In this platform, this type of user is free to manage the products' properties and categories in a way he thinks it's best for the website.
