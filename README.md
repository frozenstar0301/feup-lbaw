Made in colaboration with [Carlos Freitas](https://github.com/CarlosFr97), [Julieta Frade](https://github.com/julietafrade97) and [Lu√≠s Martins](https://github.com/luisnmartins).<br>
**Completed in 30/05/2018.**

## Project
The purpose of this project was to develop a web application for an online tech store, called **Sweven**, which means a vision seen in sleep, a dream. From the Old English to the modern days, this word inspired us. In order to have a great product diversity, the store sells multiple tech brands and product types, such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Sweven is based on **HTML5**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **PostgreSQL** and **PHP**. The **Bootstrap framework** was used to implement the user interface and when it comes to backend, it was used the **Laravel framework**.

The platform has an adaptive design and a detailed navigation system by arranging the products through categories. In order to provide a reliable service, each product has a review section, which allows users to not only review the items they purchased but also to view other people's opinions. Each review includes a score and a short description, which results in the product to have an average score. Besides, users have the ability to save favorite products in a wishlist and view the history of all previous purchases. Finally, users are distributed in three groups with different permissions: administrators, unauthenticated and authenticated users.

The Sketch App was used to develop Sweven's design, you can check it out on [my behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/71374245/Sweven-Website).
The website is live [here](http://lbaw1761.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt), but access is restricted to the **FEUP network** (or FEUP VPN). Oh, and there's a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/la9v98MQ1qc).
